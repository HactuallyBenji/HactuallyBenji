### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ahoy hoy

I am Ben

I like skiing, running (more wonky and infrequent jogging really), and writing code that looks better than my running does. Neoviming since '01, and have a very prime-inspired config if you fancy having a look [here](https://github.com/HactuallyBenji/neovimrc).
